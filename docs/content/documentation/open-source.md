### Disclaimer
{class = "text-2xl"}

The above list is not supposed to be complete or extensive by any means. ThreadTalk.JS depends on a lot more services and some of them are not free or open-source. Even then, without them, ThreadTalk.JS won't work. Furthermore, there are a lot of underlying dependencies that the above list might be using themselves. Thus, the list is endless.
