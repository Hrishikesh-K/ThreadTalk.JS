### Feature 1
{class = "text-2xl"}

An option to pin a comment to the top is in works. If it's implemented, you could pin your own or anyone else's comment to the top of the page. However, you won't be able to do this from the form because if you could, anyone can as it'd be available client-side. You'd have to do it from the database. When loading comments, this option would be checked and the comment will be kept at the top.
